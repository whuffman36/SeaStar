# General Purpose C Libraries

I've always found the C++ standard library to be interesting and fun to disect,
and I wanted to try making my own. Mostly to learn, but also because C has a
standard library that has not aged well. Lastly, I work with a lot of complex,
maybe even overengineered code in my day job and part of me wants to see if I
can design some similar, yet simpler libraries myself in C.
